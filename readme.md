This is a Python/Selenium script that will load James Quick's typing game page and enter a desiredScore. This allows a user to place on the high score page in any position they would like, including the ability to enter characters much faster than a human could do it. 

**Usage** = Edit the desiredScore variable to whatever score you would like and execute.
